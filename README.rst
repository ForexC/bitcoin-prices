Demos

Installation
-------------

No server-side components needed.

You must have `jQuery <http://jquery.com>`_ (version 1.9 or later) installed.

Put ``bitcoinprices.js`` in your application.

You manually need to call ``bitcoinprices.init()`` to trigger the loading of exchange rate data and
making price switching logic to work::

    <script src="bitcoinprices.js"></script>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function() {
            bitcoinprices.init({

                // Where we get bitcoinaverage data
                url: "https://api.bitcoinaverage.com/ticker/all",

                // Which of bitcoinaverages value we use to present prices
                marketRateVariable: "24h_avg",

                // Which currencies are in shown to the user
                currencies: ["BTC", "USD", "EUR", "CNY"],

                // Special currency symbol artwork
                symbols: {
                    "BTC": "<i class='fa fa-btc'></i>"
                },

                // Which currency we show user by the default if
                // no currency is selected
                defaultCurrency: "BTC",

                // How the user is able to interact with the prices
                ux : {
                    // Make everything with data-btc-price HTML attribute clickable
                    clickPrices : true,

                    // Build Bootstrap dropdown menu for currency switching
                    menu : true,
                },

                // Allows passing the explicit jQuery version to bitcoinprices.
                // This is useful if you are using modular javascript (AMD/UMD/require()),
                // but for most normal usage you don't need this
                jQuery: jQuery,

                // Price source data attribute
                priceAttribute: "data-btc-price",

                // Price source currency for data-btc-price attribute.
                // E.g. if your shop prices are in USD
                // but converted to BTC when you do Bitcoin
                // checkout, put USD here.
                priceOrignalCurrency: "BTC"

            });
        });
    </script>

All configuration parameters can be omitted. Then defaults from bitcoinprices.js
is used (``defaultConfig`` variable).

How it works
-----------------

Your templating language must output Bitcoin prices with `data-btc-price` attribute::

        <p>
            <div>Example price: <span data-btc-price="1.0">1.0 BTC</span></div>
        </p>

* You manually initialize the library with `bitcoinprices.init()` and give it a config you want to use,
  including bitcoinaverage.com API URL. See the demo for an example.

* ``bitcoinprices.init()`` fires HTML document ``marketdataavailable`` event when the script manages to load
  exchange rates

* Whenever the user changes price presentation format HTML document ``activecurrencychange`` event is fired

* You can manually call ``bitcoinprices.convert()`` to convert between any currencies supported
  by bitcoinaverage.com

* You can manually call call ``bitcoinprices.updatePrices()`` if your own JavaScripts
  sets the active currency and all prices on the page are updatd.

It is suggested that you cache bitcoinaverage.com API output on a local server with proper
cache headers. This may considerably speed up your site and reduces bitcoinaverage.com load.

Drupal + UberCart integration
-------------------------------

Here is another example how ``bitcoinprices.js`` is used
with popular `Drupal <https://drupal.org>`_ content management system and its `UberCart <https://drupal.org/project/ubercart>`_ eCommerce add on.

An example live site, `It's time for plan B <http://timeforplanb.org/store/>`_.

Steps for integration
======================

Change UberCart templates to output price as ``data-price-usd`` attribute.

Example modification to ``node--production.tpl.php``::

    $usd_price = round(render($content['sell_price']['#value']) , 2);

    <span data-price-usd="<?=$usd_price ?>"><?=$usd_price ?></span>

Include ``bitcoinprices.js`` in your CSS.

Add CSS styles for ``.clickable-price`` selector (prices become clickable only when succesful market data
exchange rates have been downloaded from bitcoinaverage). ``clickable-price`` CSS class is added
automatically you don't need to add it to your templates::

    .clickable-price {
        cursor: pointer;
        border-bottom: 1px #888 dashed;
    }

Include an initialization JavaScript snippet as a separate JS file::

    /**
     * Drupal + Ubercart integration for bitcoinprices.js
     *
     * Make Bitcoin prices clickable, based on the dollar amount.
     *
     * Scan document for elements with `data-price-usd` attributes,
     * make them clickable.
     */

    (function($) {

        // Entry point to processing
        $(document).ready(function() {

            bitcoinprices.init({

                // Which currencies are in shown to the user
                currencies: ["BTC", "USD", "EUR", "CNY"],

                // Which currency we show user by the default if
                // no currency is selected
                defaultCurrency: "USD",

                // How the user is able to interact with the prices
                ux : {
                    // Make everything with data-btc-price HTML attribute clickable
                    clickPrices : true,

                    // Build Bootstrap dropdown menu for currency switching
                    menu : false,
                },

                // Allows passing the explicit jQuery version to bitcoinprices.
                // This is useful if you are using modular javascript (AMD/UMD/require()),
                // but for most normal usage you don't need this
                jQuery: $,

                // Which HTML attribute hosts the price data and
                // makes elements clickable
                priceAttribute: "data-price-usd",

                // Which is the source currency for the prices
                priceOrignalCurrency: "USD"
            });
        });

    })(jQuery);

I have not completely figured out how to make a module which has a UMD + dependency to jQuery, so
that all `browserify <http://browserify.org/>`_ users would be happy with the released packages. Tips welcome.
